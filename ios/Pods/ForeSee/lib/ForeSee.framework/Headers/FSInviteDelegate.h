/** Tells the delegate that the ForeSee SDK is about to show a survey.
 
 Implement this method to override the default survey view controller.
 
 By default, the ForeSee SDK presents the survey in a custom `UIViewController` that has a toolbar
 at the bottom of the screen (with back/forward buttons), an activity indicator, and a navigation bar
 at the top. This `UIViewController` provides additional functionality, too, such as preventing navigation
 to domains not registered in the domain white list (see the `foresee_configuration.json` that was included
 with the SDK). It also closes automatically when the survey has been submitted.
 
 So, the long and short is, be fairly certain you want to use a custom view controller to display the survey!
 
 Implementation of this method is optional. Custom surveys are not required. Return `YES` to allow the
 default behavior.
 
 @param measure The measure for which a survey is about to be displayed.
 @param url The URL of the survey.
 @return NO to prevent the default survey from appearing, YES otherwise.
