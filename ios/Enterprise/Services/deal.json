  "long_description": "<p>The Netherlands is a gorgeous country in Northwestern&nbsp;Europe, renowned for its flat landscape, canals, cycling routes, windmills, and&nbsp;of course, tulips. This country offers so many amazing areas to explore;&nbsp;traveling by road will ensure that you enjoy as much of the Netherlands as you&nbsp;possibly can. Start off your adventure in the capital city of Amsterdam, where&nbsp;you can see historic sites like the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Royal&nbsp;Palace of Amsterdam, and the Anne Frank House.</p> <p>Travel to the outskirts of the cities to the Hoge Veluwe&nbsp;National Park in the province of Gelderland, where you can explore the&nbsp;heathlands, woodlands, and sand dunes that mark this vast natural wonderland.&nbsp;Make sure to venture into the city of The Hague, where you can jump between&nbsp;various monuments, historic districts, and quaint eateries that fill this&nbsp;lively town.</p> <p>If&nbsp;there's one thing that you must do before you leave the Netherlands â€“ it's&nbsp;taking a drive down the world-renowned Bollenstreek Route, also known as the&nbsp;Bloemen Route (Flower Route). This is perhaps one of the most scenic driving&nbsp;routes in the world, named by National Geographic as a \"Drive of Lifetime.\"&nbsp;This route begins in Haarlem and winds 40 km south to Leiden. The best time to&nbsp;take this drive is during the spring, when you can drive past incredibly dense,&nbsp;vast flower fields filled with tulips, daffodils, narcissi, gladioli, dahlilas,&nbsp;lilies, irises, and hyacinths. Get your camera ready for incredibly colorful,&nbsp;vibrant photos that will accompany your memories of a lifetime.</p> ",
