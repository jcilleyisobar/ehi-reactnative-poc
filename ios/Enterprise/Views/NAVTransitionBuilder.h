 @brief If all stack transitions are combined to a single transition
 
 If yes, creating successive stack transitions via @c -root, @c -push, or @c -pop will
 automatically combine the transitions internally to create a single fluid transition.
 Appending any non-supported combinable transition finalizes any currently built
 multi-step stack transition. The final transition's @c animated of a multi-step stack
 transition will determine the whole transition's @c animated.
 
 Defaults to @c YES.
